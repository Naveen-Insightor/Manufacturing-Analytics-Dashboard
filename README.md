# Manufacturing-Analytics-Dashboard
Built in Power BI to track production, rejections, and wastage. Provided insights on top defect sources, employee performance, and quarterly trends, enabling targeted quality improvements and operational efficiency
Here’s your **Manufacturing Analytics Dashboard** written in the saved 8-point format:

**🎯 Objective / Problem Statement**
To provide real-time visibility into manufacturing performance by tracking production output, rejection rates, wastage, and employee/machine efficiency, enabling data-driven quality improvement.

---

**📊 Dataset Description**
Production dataset containing:

* Daily manufactured, processed, and rejected quantities
* Wastage data
* Employee-wise and machine-wise rejection counts
* Quarterly production figures
* Product code-wise rejection details
---
**🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used**

* **Power BI** (Data modeling, DAX, dashboard design)
* **Excel** (Data cleaning & preprocessing)
---
**🔍 Key Tasks Performed**

* Data cleaning & transformation for reporting consistency
* Created KPIs for manufacture, rejected, processed, and wastage quantities
* Built employee-wise, machine-wise, and product code rejection analysis
* Designed interactive visuals with slicers for product category and quarter filtering
* Developed production comparison and manufacture vs. rejected trends
---
**📈 Key Insights / Findings**

* **Total Output:** 49.79M units manufactured with \~0.99% rejection rate
* **Top Rejections:** Shruti Singh (127K), Pooja Patel (123K), Amit Kumar (121K)
* **Quarterly Stability:** Consistent production (\~15M units per quarter)
* **High Wastage:** 75M units identified for process optimization
* **Defect Sources:** MC027 and MC026 leading defective product codes
